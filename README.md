Front-End Test Brief

You have been given the task of creating an interactive example feature for one of the landing pages. This task should take between 2 and 4 hours as a guideline.

Included are 2 mocks, one for desktops and another for mobile devices. The coded feature should look like the mock as much as possible, when loaded in example devices such as an iPhones or desktop PC. They should also degrade gracefully outside of those parameters.

We have included graphical artwork assets to be used in the test (in the /images/ folder) and a starter set of files to get you started, including a HTML, JavaScript and CSS file.

The feature should also include 4 interactive hot spots (the green circles), which when clicked on will do the following:-

    • Change the “highlighted” text on the mobile mock (each hotspot corresponds to a different word). Which hotspot corresponds to which word isn't important, but each of the four hotspots should only highlight one of the words.

    • Change the “rocket” background on the desktop mock to one of the other supplied “bg” images. Again which hotspot uses which image is not important but that each of the four bg images is used for a single hotspot.

    • The “Quicker Than A Rocket” title & accompanying text should change when different hotspots are selected. The various bits of text are as follows:-

Text 1:-
WEAVED UPPER 
A new Flyknit weave technology with an elevated fit and feel featuring a lighter and smoother experience that molds to your foot.

Text 2:-
QUICKER THAN A ROCKET 
Okay, so maybe it's not quicker than a rocket. React gives you that instant go you need to do mile after mile, run after run.

Text 3:-
SOOOO SQUISHY 
React is soft and squishy, yet responsive and stable. It gives you the cushioning you need to hit mile after mile.

Text 4:-
JUST LIKE A KANGAROO 
Ridiculously responsive. Nike React foam bounces the energy of your stride right back at you, and keeps bouncing right back at you even after hundreds of miles.

If you have any time left, add some animations or fancy effects as you see fit. If you do not finish the task, do not worry as this test is intended to let us see how you would approach the types of tasks the Frontend team is regularly set.
